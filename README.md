## File Backup using Shell Script:

>  A script designed to perform file backup using a shell script.
>  It specifies a source directory containing the files to be backed up and a destination directory where the backups will be stored.
>  The script creates the destination directory if it doesn't exist, then copies files from the source directory to the destination directory.
>  Additionally, it performs basic error checking, ensuring that the source directory exists before proceeding with the backup.
